<h1>My Skills</h1>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>I have been into computing for a long while and recently picked up coding so that I can finally create the projects and apps I would personally want to use.
<br></br>
<br></br>
For the past few months, I've been at BCIT doing the CST program learning the skills neccesary to make projects I'm proud of. I want to learn more so I can make programs that are useful to everyone.
<br></br>
<br></br>
I hope to land a full stack developer position and am eagerly awaiting the future!
